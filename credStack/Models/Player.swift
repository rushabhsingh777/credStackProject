For a specific time period in his playing days he was at once the most hated and most loved player in the team. His captaincy tenure has got to be one of the most chronicled ones in recent times. Ganguly retains his magnetic ability to attract attention much like his playing days when things like him waving his shirt on the Lord's balcony, his coming late for the toss etc grabbed headlines. He has also taken a new avatar as a TV analyst and commentator but he remained an active player in the domestic circuit even three years after his retirement and played both in the Ranji trophy and the IPL with sporadic success until 2012." ,shortDescription: "Prince of Jungle"),

Dhoni is considered as one the best wicket-keepers in world cricket and is also one of the finest captains India has ever had. He made his debut in the One Day International (ODI) in December 2004 and played his first Test a year later. During Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian cricket team won the highest rank in all formats, including the No.1 Test ranking for 18 months starting December 2009, 50-over World Cup (2011) and World Twenty20 on his captaincy debut in 2007.  Throughout his career, Dhoni has showed excellent leadership skills, which was recognised when Rahul Dravid gave up captaincy in 2007.",shortDescription: "Lion of Jungle"),

In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.",shortDescription: "King of Jungle"),]
